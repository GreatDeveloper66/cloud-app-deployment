# Cloud App Deployment (DevOps Practice)

This project demonstrates deploying a simple web application to a local simulated cloud virtual machine using Linux and SSH.

The focus of this project is infrastructure and deployment, not application logic.

Infrastructure:

- Linux VM (Ubuntu Server)
- Provisioned locally to simulate cloud infrastructure
- Accessed exclusively via SSH

Future Improvements:

- Replace local VM with cloud provider
- Automate provisioning with Terraform
